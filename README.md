### Description

This is the successor to my GetMetar Weather program. I spiffed up the interface and the dynamics within it. It does the same things as GetMetar, but looks better. There is now a location wizard for selecting locations and the locations are now in a Microsoft Access database. Thanks to everyone for all your support! Don't forget to vote! (If download does not work, go to my website at http://binsurf.net without the www.)
